# Promise - a mathematical protocol to safely blochainify any puzzle game

There are games to tell stories. There are games to solve mysteries. If there is only one way to solve a level - only one answer then Promise works.
Any such game old or new, be it placing mirrors to guide the laser through the labirynth, finding one concept which unites four pictures, or guessing which brand is on the logo, can be brought to blockchain. 

Why should we blochainify what is not broken? 
Something never possible pre-blockchain and pre-chatGPT happens. 

> The game can Promise payout or scores for the right answer. The game can Promise that 

## A more technical viewpoint

From a technical point of view Promise is a gaming escrow which first gurantees payout / decincentivizes any fraud, second makes sure 
Proof of content. Which seems important in the age of neural net autogenerated content. Imagine that each person 
receives his own personal generated level. There has to be a way to safely sell and buy personal levels. This way is Promise.

One half of Promise is an escrow with hashed challenge-response pairs. It deincentivizes lying and non-participation for game company and player, guarantees payouts for right answers. This is not a regular escrow, but has a very particular player / game interaction scheme:

1. The player books a question.
2. The oracle has to reveal question's plain text. It has to match the question hash. The plain text can be a link to ipfs with a picture or a whole level folder.
3. If the oracle does not respond in time, player is eligible to call a money-back method.
4. The player sees the question and has to answer before timeout. Otherwise oracle can take his payment.
5. The oracle has to reveal the true (matching the hash) answer before timeout. Otherwise the player receives a compensation.
6. If player's answer mathced the oracle answer then he receives a prize. Otherwise oracle just takes his payment. 


This fair scheme is enforced via a state machine implemented in the contract.
The only seeming caveat after this step: what if pre-loaded question-answer pairs.
It is handled by the other half of Promise.


The other half is shuffler of challenges, which using Verifiable Random Functions, randomly permutates i.e shuffling them.
1. A set of question-answer pair hashes are pre-loaded into the contract.
