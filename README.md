# Promise - a mathematical protocol to safely blochainify any puzzle game

There are games to tell stories. There are games to solve mysteries. If there is only one way to solve a level - only one answer then Promise works.
Any such game old or new, be it placing mirrors to guide the laser through the labirynth, finding one concept which unites four pictures, or guessing which brand is on the logo, can be brought to blockchain. 

Why should we blochainify what is not broken? 
Something never possible pre-blockchain and pre-chatGPT happens.

## A more technical viewpoint

From a technical point of view Promise is a gaming escrow which first gurantees payout / decincentivizes any fraud, second makes sure 
Proof of content. Which seems important in the age of neural net autogenerated content.


One half of Promise is an escrow with hashed challenge-response pairs. It deincentivizes lying and non-participation for game company and player, guarantees payouts for right answers. This is not a regular escrow, but has a very particular player / game interaction scheme:



This fair scheme is enforced via a state machine implemented in the contract.




The other half is shuffler of challenges, which using Verifiable Random Functions, randomly permutates i.e shuffling them.

From a cryptography point of view it's an attempt to
